- **SLEEP** (Gray) - Sleep mode

### Clearing Alarms

If the machine enters ALARM state:

**Method 1 - Use Popup:**
1. ALARM popup appears automatically
2. Tap **Clear Alarm** button
3. Wait for state to change to IDLE

3. If needed, tap **Reset** to fully restart

### Homing the Machine

Before first use, home your machine:

1. Go to **Control → Actions**
2. Tap **Home All** to home all axes
3. Or tap individual **Home X/Y/Z** buttons
4. Wait for homing cycle to complete
5. Status bar shows "IDLE" when done

## Jogging

### Button-Based Jogging (Jog Tab)

**XY Jogging:**
1. Go to **Control → Jog**
2. Select **step size** (100, 50, 10, 1, 0.1 mm)
3. Tap **direction buttons** on jog pad
   - Diagonal buttons move both axes
   - N/S buttons move Y only
   - E/W buttons move X only
4. Adjust **feed rate** with ±100 / ±1000 buttons
5. Tap **STOP** to cancel movement

**Z Jogging:**
1. Select **Z step size** (50, 25, 10, 1, 0.1 mm)
2. Tap **Z+** or **Z-** buttons
3. Adjust **feed rate** independently
4. Tap **STOP** to cancel

### Analog Jogging (Joystick Tab)

**XY Joystick:**
1. Go to **Control → Joystick**
2. Drag the **circular joystick** knob
3. Distance from center = speed (quadratic response)
4. Release to stop

**Z Slider:**
1. Drag the **vertical slider** knob
2. Up = Z+, Down = Z-
3. Distance from center = speed
4. Release to stop

**Feed Rate:**
- Set max feed rates in **Settings → Jog**
- Joystick/slider position scales from 0% to 100% of max

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Won't Connect

**Check:**
- SSID and password are correct (case-sensitive)
- WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Router is in range and operational

**Note:** If importing settings, WiFi passwords must be manually re-entered for security reasons.

### Can't Connect to FluidNC

**Check:**
- FluidNC is powered on and responsive
- IP address/hostname is correct
- Port is correct (80 for v4.0+, 81 for v3.x default)
- Both devices on same WiFi network
- WiFi password is configured (check machine settings)

**Try:**
- Access FluidNC WebUI from browser
- Check FluidNC YAML configuration for WebSocket port
- Restart both FluidTouch and FluidNC

### Settings Lost After Power Cycle

FluidTouch stores settings in non-volatile memory, but if settings are lost:

**Prevention:**
1. Go to **Settings → General**
2. Tap **Export Settings**
3. Keep backup file on Display SD card
4. Copy backup to computer for safekeeping

**Recovery:**
1. Insert Display SD card with `fluidtouch_settings.json`
2. Go to **Settings → General → Clear All Settings**
3. Restart triggers automatic import
4. Re-enter WiFi passwords

### Import/Export Issues

**Export Failed:**
- Ensure Display SD card is inserted
- Check SD card has free space
- Try removing and re-inserting SD card
- Restart device and try again

**Auto-Import Not Working:**
- Verify file is named exactly `fluidtouch_settings.json`
- File must be in root directory of Display SD card
- Auto-import only works when no machines are configured
- Check file is valid JSON (view in text editor)
